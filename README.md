## Multi-Agent Systems

# 🤖 Multi-Agent Systems with CrewAI + OpenAI

This repository explores the design and orchestration of multi-agent systems using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/) and OpenAI models. It demonstrates how to coordinate autonomous agents to solve complex tasks collaboratively.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repo showcases how multiple agents can:
- Collaborate on multi-step tasks
- Delegate subtasks to each other
- Communicate using natural language
- Integrate with external tools or APIs

Built with:
- 🧠 [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/): Framework for agent orchestration
- 🔮 [OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/): LLMs powering each agent
- ⚙️ Python + LangChain (optional) + dotenv
